/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * You’re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. Find whether the list
 * contains any cycle (or loop). A linked list is said to contain cycle if any node
 * is re-visited while traversing the list. The head pointer given may be null meaning
 * that the list is empty.
 * <p>
 * Input Format:
 * You have to complete the int HasCycle(Node* head) method which takes one argument -
 * the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. Number
 * of nodes in a linked list doesn't exceed 100.
 * <p>
 * Output Format:
 * Check whether the linked list has a cycle and return 1 if there is a cycle. Otherwise,
 * return 0. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input:
 * 1 --> NULL
 * <p>
 * 1 --> 2 --> 3
 * ^     |
 * |     |
 * -----
 * <p>
 * Sample Output:
 * 0
 * 1
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * 1. First list has no cycle, hence return 0
 * 2. Second list is shown to have a cycle, hence return 1.
